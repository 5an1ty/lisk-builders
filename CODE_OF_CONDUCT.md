# Purpose
A primary goal of this Code of Conduct is to be inclusive to the largest number of contributors, with the most varied and diverse backgrounds possible. As such, we are committed to providing a friendly, safe, positive and welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, political orientation, group apartenience, ability, ethnicity, socioeconomic status and religion (or lack thereof).

This Code of Conduct outlines our expectations for all those who participate in our community, as well as the consequences for unacceptable behavior.

We invite all those who participate in our events to help us create safe and positive experiences for everyone.

**tl;dr: Be excellent with each other**

# Open [Source/Culture/Tech] Citizenship
A supplemental goal of this Code of Conduct is to increase open [source/culture/tech] citizenship by encouraging participants to recognize and strengthen the relationships between our actions and their effects on our community.

Communities mirror the societies in which they exist and positive action is essential to counteract the many forms of inequality and abuses of power that exist in society.

If you see someone who is making an extra effort to ensure our community is welcoming, friendly, and encourages all participants to contribute to the fullest extent, we want to know.

# Expected Behavior
Participate in an authentic and active way. In doing so, you contribute to the health and longevity of this community.
Exercise consideration and respect in your speech and actions.
Attempt collaboration before conflict.
Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and speech.
Be mindful of your surroundings and of your fellow participants. Alert community leaders if you notice a dangerous situation, someone in distress, or violations of this Code of Conduct, even if they seem inconsequential.

# Unacceptable Behavior
Unacceptable behaviors include: intimidating, harassing, abusive, hate, discriminatory, derogatory or demeaning speech or actions by any participant in our community online, at all related events and in one-on-one communications carried out in the context of community business.

Harassment includes: harmful or prejudicial verbal or written comments related to gender, sexual orientation, race, religion, disability; inappropriate use of nudity and/or sexual images; inappropriate depictions of violence; deliberate intimidation, stalking or following; harassing photography or recording; sustained disruption of talks or other events; inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

# Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior
Unacceptable behavior from any community member, including sponsors and those with decision-making authority, will not be tolerated. Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately.

If a community member engages in unacceptable behavior, the community leaders may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including a temporary ban or permanent expulsion from the community without warning.

# If You Witness or Are Subject to Unacceptable Behavior
If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please notify a community leader as soon as possible. You can find a list of leaders to contact for each of the supporters of this code of conduct at the bottom of this page. Additionally, community leaders are available to help community members engage with local law enforcement or to otherwise help those experiencing unacceptable behavior feel safe.

# Addressing Grievances
If you feel you have been falsely or unfairly accused of violating this Code of Conduct, you should notify one of the community leaders with a concise description of your grievance. Your grievance will be handled in accordance with our existing governing policies.
