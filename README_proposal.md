<h3>LiskPro.com - Edition</h3>
<p>Because we are not coders, <strong>LiskPro.com</strong> would like to promote LISK with it's own experience in IT security and web hosting.</p>
<p>With more than <strong>10 years of experience</strong>, the team is ready to face new threads and bugs detection by running some Main-and-Test Node in a high-end security architecture.</p>
<p>With this <em>shy</em> pull-request, we would like to get in <strong>lisk.builders</strong> not only to help you but to help the Lisk Community.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Currently, we are working on our website which will share information about LISK to the French-Countries. We aim to write Lisk information in a human readable language to improve the impact of our message. So our website will have two levels. One with non-technical and human readable informations, the second with high-end and quality technical information.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we will set up meetups and presentations in some big Belgian university with the help of one of our member who has strong knowledge in cryptography.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please, consider our proposition to join <strong>lisk.builders</strong>. We could help you to spread your work around the (french-)world !</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>
